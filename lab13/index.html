	<h1>Lab 13: Debugging</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Overall this lab was relatively straight forward once we figured out what we were doing. We started off by trying to answer questions on stack overflow however we had difficulty answering any of the questions because we have yet to learn many of the things that are being asked on that website. So following that we decided to add to our Lab 10 which we felt we couldve added more to when we originally submitted it.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 10</h3>
	<p>For this portion of the lab of the lab we literally copied the exact same lab from our Lab 10 where we made an Alphabetize Function. We chose this lab to be the lab that we would fix because around this time we were trying to make an Anagram function alongside the Alphabetizing function however we ran out of time so now we're going back to fix it.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>The only difference between this lab and lab 10 is the addition of the anagram function. First we began by duplicating our Alphabetizing function and editing it to say Anagram in the HTML. Next we created the Anagram function in the JS file. This required us to do some rewiring on our original Alphabetizing function including adding a shuffleArray inorder for the Anagram to work. Overall it was relatively easy to accomplish with the help of Stack Overflow.</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
	<p>After testing the file locally we uploaded to Github.</p>
	<h1>ALPHABETIZ-O-RAY!</h1>
	<p>Enter any word to alphabetize it!</p>
	<p><input type="text" id="input1"></p>
	<p><button id = "button1" class="fancy-button">Go!</button></p>
	<h1>ANAGRAM!</h1>
	<p>Enter any word to convert it into a new one!</p>
	<p><input type="text" id="input2"></p>
