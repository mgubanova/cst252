	<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
	<p>This lab involved experimentation with for loops and conditionals. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Overall, this lab was relatively easy for us once we recalled what we learned during class especially with the help of the screenshots that we took during class.</p>
		<p>Creating the 0 - 200 counter was really easy. From there we created the If Else as well as the Else statements which was also super easy. We recalled the issue we ran into during our class breakout rooms where we needed to put the FizzBuzz statement above the Fizz and Buzz statements in order for it to catch those numbers and avoided recreating that dilemma. Following that we just tested locally until it worked and pushed to origin.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results of this lab are a list of numbers from 0-200 that are replaced with either Fizz, Buzz, Boom or a combination of them depending on if the numbers are divisible by a certain number.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
		<p>Recalling our in class assignment that we did in breakout rooms we were able to complete this portion of the lab with ease. We first created a 0 - 200 counter and from there we created our Else If statements and lastly made the adjustments to insure that the counter would show up on our webpage in the form of an output .div</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
		<p>As always, we tested locally and made sure our output div functioned correctly before pushing the code to origin.</p>
		<p>We also played around with our css to make sure that the output is displayed in columns and doesn't take too much space on the page.</p>
