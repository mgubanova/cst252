	<h1>Lab 17: Advanced jQuery</h1>
	<p></p>
	<div id="challenges">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Overall this lab was relatively easy especially after first completing lab16 which we had slight difficulty with. We also referenced our screenshots from class and reviewed the lecture notes to help us complete this lab.</p>
		<button id="challenges-button">Change!</button>
	</div>
	<div id="results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for your lab</h3>
		<p>For this lab we created two buttons on our page. The first button is located under our challenges header in the lab. This button causes the background of the challenges portion of the lab to turn green, the text to display vertically with upright orientation and the text to display at 50% of its original size. The second button is located in the results portion of the lab and this button causes that section of the page to become purple and the text to increase in size by 900%.</p>
		<button id="results-button">Change!</button>

		<p>As explained in the results section of this lab we made two buttons on this lab and made them cause the portion of the page they are assigned to to change drastically.</p>
		<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
		<p>After testing the file locally we uploaded to Github.</p>
