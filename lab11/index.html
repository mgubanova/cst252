	<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>This lab was interesting but not challenging for us. The only issue we had was with getting the sortingHat function to work properly. We made two mistakes.</p>
	<p>At first, we put the conditional outside the function, and we got an error "mod is not defined" in console. We realized why and moved the if statements so that it would be within the function, and the problem disappeared.</p>
	<p>Second, we used "house = "Gryffindor" instead of using "return". We did so in accordance with the example from the class, and it didn't work this way. But then we looked at Wes's code for this lab and tried with "return" - and it worked perfectly.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 11</h3>
	<p>We used the index file from a previous lab like we typically do.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>We copied our javascript file from Lab 10 and followed the instructions for the Lab 11 to create a sortingHat function and use it in the buttonPress function that we created earlier for Lab 10.</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
	<p>We tested the program locally and inspected it in the browser until it ran without errors, then we pushed everything to Git and tested without any problems as well.</p>
