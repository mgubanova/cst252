	<h1>Lab 6: JavaScript Arrays and Objects</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we learned to create arrays and objects in JavaScript.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>We followed the instructions and completed all the tasks easily.</p>
	<p>The only challenge we had was when we tried to create a function inside the object to calculate the age of the vehicle using the "year" variable.
	We tried multiple methods we found on Stack Overflow and W3Schools, and didn't succeed. The function wouldn't work. We decided to deal with it later since we haven't talked about functions in class yet.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. JavaScript Arrays and Objects</h3>
	<p>We experimented in console and successfully completed all the tasks - declared an array and an object, referenced them and used console.log to print them out.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. A JavaScript Program</h3>
	<p>We simply copied and pasted the code from the console into an Atom javascript file, added some comments and the commands for printing out the array and the object. We used the JSON command suggested by Wes to print out the object and it worked perfectly.</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Create an index.html for Lab 6</h3>
	<p>We used the html file from Lab 5 to create the new page. We changed the text and images and checked how the JavaScript output works - first locally, then pushed to Git.</p>
