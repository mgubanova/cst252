	<h1>Lab 14: Javascript Classes and Objects</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn how to create a JavaScript conductor.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Overall this lab was extremely easy for us especially with the help of the screenshots we took during class as well as saving our repl.it file that we worked on with our breakout groups during class.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 10</h3>
	<p>Like our previous labs we based this HTML file on our previous labs.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>We began by defining the output field where our javascript code would end up showing on our webpage. After that we defined our constructor which for this lab was our vehicles. Next we chose which categories we wanted in our function. We ended up going with Type, Make, Model, Year, and Color. Next we created our objects using the conductor. After that we created an array of our objects and lastly we created a for loop for our array of objects.</p>
