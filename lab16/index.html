	<div id="challenges">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Overall this lab was relatively simple and straightforward however we did run into a slight problem when trying to create the button using JQuery. The problem being we were trying to create an id for our button in the same JQuery line that we were using to create the button which we eventually learned wasn't possible.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for your lab</h3>
		<p>As always we based our html on our previous labs the only difference this time being that we linked the latest version of JQuery to our lab as well.</p>

		<p>As we mentioned in the challenges portion of this page we had a slight struggle with how to correctly code a button using only JQuery however we were eventually able to figure it out.</p>
		<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
		<p>After testing the file locally we uploaded to Github.</p>
