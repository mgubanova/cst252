	<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we learned to define and run simple functions.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>We didn't have any particular challenges working on this lab because we've already tried using the sorting function in class.</p>
	<p>We used Wes's example as inspiration and created a JavaScript program requesting user output, taking a string and sorting it in the alphabetical order.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 7</h3>
	<p>We used the index file from a previous lab as a template. We changed the css for this index so that the output is displayed the same way as the images and in the bigger font - this way it's easier to spot the result of the JavaScript program.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>We drafted and discussed the code and decided to have the function convert the input into lowercase string to avoid problems with sorting because the sort method treats uppercase and lowercase differently - it puts uppercase above lowercase disregarding the letter.</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
	<p>We tested the program locally and it run without errors, then we pushed everything to Git and tested without any problems as well.</p>
