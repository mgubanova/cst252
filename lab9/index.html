	<h1>Lab 9: Javascript for the Web</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we experimented with editing information on our HTML document using the JavaScript file by adding and editing elements.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Overall this lab was quite easy for us. Whenever we were confused about how to code a certain part we referred back to the screenshots that we both took during the lecture.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 9</h3>
	<p>Like last time we used the index file from a previous lab as a template. We didn't adjust the css at all this time and the only changes we done in the JavaScript file</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>The results for this lab were two elements made in our JavaScript file one being a sentence that is shown in a serif font and the other element was another sentence that is colored blue.</p>

	<p>Like in the previous labs we tested the program locally and it ran without errors, then we pushed everything to Git and tested without any problems as well.</p>
