	<h1>Lab 4: Data Types and Variables</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn how to define variables in JavaScript, use console and program basic operations.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The tasks were pretty straightforward and we completed them easily and quickly.</p>
	<p>There was a problem with the “document.writeln” function - at first we thought that it had a upper-case "I" instead of a lower-case "l", so we mistyped the function at first and it didn't work. After some google search we realized what was the problem and fixed it.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<h2>Task 1. JavaScript Variables</h2>
	<p>We tried defining and referencing the variables in the console, it worked fine. The calculation of the car age went well, too.</p>

	<h2>Task 2. A JavaScript Program</h2>
	<p>We did the same thing in the lab.js file in Atom: defined the variables, calculated the age and scripted the output of the variables and calculation results.</p>

	<h2>Task 3. Create an index.html for Lab 5</h2>
	<p>We created this page and linked the JavaScript file to it, check it out:</p>
