	<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we anonymous functions and callbacks and tried a new way to display javascript output on the page.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>We didn't have any challenges working on this lab because we followed and tried all the functions in class.</p>
	<p>We created a JavaScript program displaying three strings in various order and with scheduled time.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 7</h3>
	<p>We used the index file from a previous lab as a template. We changed the css for this index so that the output is displayed right at the center of the page.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>We wrote the code for all the three tests and it worked right away - we saw it in the console.</p>
	<p>Then we tried to connect the program to the html file using the new method that Wes showed in class. We couldn't figure out how it works by the example he gave in class, so we checked the html and js files on his website for the lab 8 and recreated these parts in our files. At first, we misplaced the curly bracket and got an error - we put it right after the window.onload function but then realized it should be at the very end of the whole program, and it worked.</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
	<p>We tested the program locally and it run without errors, then we pushed everything to Git and tested without any problems as well.</p>
