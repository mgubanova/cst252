	<h1>Lab 10: Functions</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Working on this lab we originally thought would be extremely simple. However we ran into slight difficulty trying to figure out how to make the button press function connect to the sorting function. The solution ended up being to combine our sorting function with our button press function which we originally had as seperate functions.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<h3>Task 1. Create an index.html for Lab 7</h3>
	<p>We used the index file from a previous lab like we typically do. We added to our css file to make our button look fancy.</p>

	<h3>Task 2. Create a JavaScript file</h3>
	<p>For our JavaScript file like i mentioned in the challenges portion of this lab we had slight difficulty with figuring out how to make our function work but eventually we were able to figure it out. In our button press function we also added a sorting function in order to create a more interesting final product.</p>

	<h3>Task 3. Test, Debug, and Upload</h3>
	<p>We tested the program locally specifically the function portion until it ran without errors, then we pushed everything to Git and tested without any problems as well.</p>
