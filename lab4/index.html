	<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to teach us the basics of problem solving and how to pseudocode a program before jumping into coding.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Both tasks were pretty easy and we enjoyed completing them.</p>
	<p>The only challenge we had is deciding which steps are high-level and which are low-level, and what steps should we include to avoid going into the weeds.
		We did our best to look at the action lists from the point of view of someone who has to learn how to do the task.
	</p>
	<p>For the computer task, we were unsure if we wanted it to be a two-player game or a one player game where a human is playing with the computer.
		We decided to go with the first option. Weâ€™ve researched the process of designing a chess game and decided that the program should have classes defined for each element.
		The pseudocode does not include the class defining part but only the actions list that the program will do to complete a game of chess.

	<h1>Results</h1>
	<h2>Task 1. Framing a piece of art</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Measure the artwork</li>
			<ul class="roman">
				<li>Length</li>
				<li>Width</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Get supplies</li>
			<ul class="roman">
				<li>Pieces of wood for a frame. (sufficient for the size of the artwork)</li>
				<li>Piece of glass for a frame. (sufficient for the size of the artwork)</li>
				<li>Adhesive to glue frame together</li>
				<li>Screw hooks for back wiring</li>
				<li>Backing paper. (sufficient for the size of the frame)</li>
				<li>Wiring to hang the framed picture</li>
				<li>Cardboard backing. (sufficient for the size of the artwork)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Build the frame</li>
			<ul class="roman">
				<li>Glue the four pieces of wood together, making the frame</li>
				<li>Cut the glass to the appropriate size so that it fits into the frame</li>
				<li>Place glass in frame</li>
				<li>Prepare the artwork to be hung</li>
				<li>Place artwork in frame behind glass</li>
				<li>Place cardboard backing behind artwork</li>
				<li>Adhese backing paper to the back of the wooden frame</li>
				<li>Drill hooks into the back of the frame at an equal height</li>
				<li>Tie wiring to the hooks allowing from the frame to be hung on a wall</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
	<h2>Task 2. Creating a chess game</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Print the board and pieces before each game</li>
			<li>Prompt user input</li>
			<li>Receive user input</li>
			<li>Validate the input</li>
			<ul class="roman">
				<li>Check the piece and its parameters</li>
				<li>Compare to the piece moving rules</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Deny the input (repeat step 2), or</li>
			<li>Accept the input</li>
			<ul class="roman">
				<li>Send input data to the opponent</li>
				<li>Update printed cells to reflect the new positions of the chess piece</li>
				<li>Test for win condition</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Repeat steps 2-5 until win condition is met</li>
			<li>Prompt the winning user side of the board with confetti!</li>
		</ol>
	<h2>Task 3. Turning pseudocode into comments</h2>
		<pre>// Name: Chess Game Pseudocode
// Authors: Sebastian Tamiano, Marta Gubanova

// Print the board and pieces before each game
// Prompt user input
// Receive user input
// Validate the input
    // Check the piece and its parameters
    // Compare to the piece moving rules
//  Accept or deny the input
    // Send input data to the opponent
    // Update printed cells to reflect the new positions of the chess piece
    // Test for win condition
// Repeat steps 2-5 until win condition is met
// Prompt the winning user side of the board with confetti!
